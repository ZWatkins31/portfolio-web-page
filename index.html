      <h3 id="intro"> Intro </h3>
      <p>Born and raised in Portland, Oregon; so naturally I love the outdoors. An hour away from the beach, an hour
         away from the mountain, and an hour away from the gorge is exactly where i'm supposed to be.</p>

      <h3 id="about-me"> About Me</h3> 
      <p>After graduating from Portland State University with a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering I started a career 
         building offshore vessels utilizing my mechanical engineering knowledge. I began to grow a passion for working on barge 
         systems which became my primary role as a Marine Design Engineer.</p>
        
      <p>Always eager to learn and better myself as an engineer, I decided that I needed change and chose to pursue software engineering,
        which I've been interested in since I was briefly indroduced to coding in college. I now find myself enrolled at in Thinkful's
        Software Engineering Bootcamp wanting to better my coding skills and more excited than ever to take on this new challenge.</p>
